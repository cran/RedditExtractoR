Description: Reddit is an online bulletin board and a social networking website where registered users can submit and discuss content. This package uses Reddit API to extract Reddit data using Reddit API. Note that due to the API limitations, the number of comments that can extracted is limited to 500 per thread. The package consists of 4 functions, one for extracting relevant URLs, one for extracting features out of given URLs, one that does both together and one that constructs graphs based on the structure of a thread.
